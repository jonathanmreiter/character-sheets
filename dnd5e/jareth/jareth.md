## Backstory
- Born in the High Ice, in a nest atop a cracked mytallar
  - Frost Orb had about a dozen Aarakocra
  - Its fatal exterior and blinding reflection made it the perfect means to defend against the nest's natural predators (Frost Giants)
  - Frost Orbs track their proud history back to the Beastlands (The Parliament), came to Toril in -4th century to study the arcane arts in Thultanthar (Nethowls)
  - With the fall of Netheril, the Nethowls split into a diaspora, with one of the smallest improbably surviving in The Great Sand Sea, eventually migrating through the High Ice and into the Endless Ice Sea.
  - They live a precarious existence, trading mostly with travelling Cloud Giants or adventurers with particular affinity to Netheril history
- Left his nest after exhausting the educational efforts of Chief Oz. The elder envied Jareth's bright mind, but grew exhausted with his preening, flirtatious behavior and the danger he brought to the nest
- Settled in the Ice Spires bordering Hartsvale 20 years ago, on a suggestion from a long family friend and mentor, Ann (Annam-Alki, Cloud Giant and Cleric of Strongmas)
- Although he made trade with the locals, he kept to his own in a tree house of his own construction, and felt he was an outsider
  - Helped the Hartsvale militia patrol for ogres
  - Acted as (a rather unorthodox) witness for a Hartvale (Herbror) firbolg legal case
  - Helping the White Mink Uthgardt to survey a territorial border with the Great Worm Uthgardt
- 10 years ago, he helped drive an exiled frost giant (Leifi) from the local Hazy Maze Caves, as part of a circuitous favor for the Hartsvale militia who were trying to cease supply raids by the Bone-Tuggz Clan of goblins by diverting them to their old dwelling
- Improbably, not only did the Bone-Tuggz cease their raiding, they established nominal relations with Hartsvale (with restitution, of a sort), and bestowed upon Jareth the title of Goblin King for his efforts
- Attempts to institute a ruling council, but only has made the clan more habituated to adopt his off-the-cuff ideas earnestly, and have only further endeared themselves to Jareth
- Ultimate wish: to learn the fate of all brethren, their history and means of getting on, and to provide them with the means to return to The Beastlands
