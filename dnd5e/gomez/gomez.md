# Gomez Aldedans

## Details
- Failed Merchant
- Fallen Aasimar
- Neutral Good

## Backstory
- Sickly child, grew up in an orphanage in Elturel, rotted by some horrible corruption brought forth from the Reckoning, and spurned from Celestia
- As a teenager, gained the trust of Thing (Tehleem ibn Garshah), a Noble Djinn who has been soul trapped into a preserved human hand, by outwitting a Cambion, Lord Munster (by saying his real name, which he has since forgotten)
- Thing has put a hold on the blight within Gomez. And in exchange, he does Thing's bidding,
- Gomez loves Thing like a brother and will serve him to the ends of the earth
- Thing just needs power to get away from Gomez and return to his role as Vizier of the Great Caliph, which he misses dearly, but not necessarily selflessly
- Gomez has risen to power by happenstance, failing his way into a modest (but inaccessible) fortune, and it is unknown whether it is Thing or himself that is propelling him forward


## Personality
- Charming, selfless, goofy
- Equal measures refined and childlike
- A true romantic and idealist, dreaming of showing Celestia to Thing
- Always smoking a stogie (his arcane focus)
